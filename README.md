# Advertisement Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements an advanced advertisement recommendation system that predicts user click-through behavior using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system analyzes user characteristics, advertisement features, and contextual information to deliver highly personalized ad recommendations, achieving exceptional performance metrics including a log loss of 0.08 and AUC score of 0.97 with the XGBoost implementation.

## Project Structure
The project follows a systematic approach to building an ad recommendation system:
1. **Data Acquisition & Preparation**
   - Library imports and environment setup
   - Dataset download and initial exploration
   - Comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Extensive visualizations to understand patterns and relationships
   - Analysis of CTR across various dimensions (demographics, time, etc.)
   
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creation of user, ad, interaction, and time-based features
   
4. **Model Development**
   - Implementation of baseline models and advanced deep learning architectures
   - Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

## Features
This recommendation system offers several key features:
- **Personalized Ad Targeting**: Uses user behavior and preferences to deliver relevant ads
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Considers demographics, shopping behavior, temporal patterns, and geographical factors
- **High-performance Predictions**: Achieves industry-leading accuracy metrics
- **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Leverages user, ad, and interaction-based features
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning to capture complex user-ad relationships

## Data Processing
The data pipeline includes:
- Handling missing values through appropriate imputation techniques
- Merging multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis
- Feature normalization and encoding
- Data validation and integrity checks

## Visualizations
The project includes extensive visualizations to gain insights:
- CTR distribution analysis
- CTR vs. ad price correlation
- Categorical breakdowns (by gender, age group, shopping behavior)
- Temporal trend analysis (hourly patterns)
- Geographic analysis (urban vs. rural)
- Brand performance comparison
